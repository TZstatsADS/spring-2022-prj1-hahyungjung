### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Anlaysis of Philosophers' Texts In Text Mining
+ This project is conducted by Hahyung Jung

+ Project summary: This project is scraping the texts of Philosophy from the csv file, tokenizing the texts, arranging the texts, analyzing the texts, and displaying data analysis. First, we analyze positive & negative aspects of authors' texts through NRC sentiment analysis. Second, we categorize the sentiments on the schools' texts and analyze the sentiment value of the texts of each school. Third, we make term frequency combine to calculate a term's tf-idf to analyze the weight of words; also, we discover the correlation among schools this by finding the pairwise correlation of word frequencies within each school's texts.
